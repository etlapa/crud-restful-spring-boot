CRUD Rest Services with Spring based on 
https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/

Adding PDF with same instructions than link above
steps/Building REST services with Spring.pdf

Step 1 - Creating a new Spring Project at Spring Initializr web site:
>	https://start.spring.io/

>	see 'steps' folder in the project

Step 2 - Add domain object: Product.
>	Additionally the library Lombok was added in order to use annotations instead of manual setters and getters. More info at:
	https://projectlombok.org/

Step 3 - Adding JPA annotations and repository

Step 4 - DataBase loading

Step 5 - Adding the product controller (services exposure)

Step 6 - Catching exceptions. If the product ID is not found, a 500 error is return, but in the following exception is never handled:
>	java.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present

>	This an unchecked exception that can be customized by extending RuntimeException: ProductNotFoundException

Step 7 - Customizing response. It returns a custom error messsage with the status code 404

Step 8 - Returning customized JSON response.

Step 9 - Solving the CORS issue for local testing purposes. More details:

Step 10 - Running service with docker. (Optional)
*	run the command
>	./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=springio/crud-restful-docker

*	run the container
>	docker run -p 8081:8080 -t springio/crud-restful-docker

	Where:
		8081 can be replaced by any port available on the host
		8080 is the port where the service is running 'inside' the container
